# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice
A repository for practice implementing and evaluating software engineering, data structures, and algorithms in various languages.

## Progress
The following tables show the data structures and algorithms contained within this repository and the languages in which they have been implemented. An empty language column means that this is in the works.
